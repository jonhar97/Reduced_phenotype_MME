# Fast multi-trait analysis
The aim of the project is to introduce dimension reduction of outcome variables in multi-trait analysis.

# Data

The Scots pine example data and pedigree are provided in the directory data. The data contains all pre-adjusted phenotypes following Dutkowski and colleagues [[1]](#1), where trial design factors have been removed including AR1 adjustment of the residuals.
