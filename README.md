# Fast multi-trait analysis
The aim of the project is to introduce dimension reduction of outcome variables in multi-trait analysis.

# Data
## Scots pine field trial
The Scots pine example data and pedigree are provided in the directory data. The data contains all pre-adjusted phenotypes following Dutkowski and colleagues [[1]](#1), where trial design factors have been removed including AR1 adjustment of the residuals.
## Loblolly pine data set
The Loblolly pine data example was provided as a part of the genomic selection benchmark data collection in Genetics [[2]](#2). The issue can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/190/4/1503/6064084).
